What Is OpenNebula Community Edition
====================================

OpenNebula is an open-source cloud management platform that combines virtualization and container technologies with multi-tenancy, automatic provision and elasticity to offer on-demand applications and services on enterprise, hybrid and edge environments.

The Community Edition (CE) of OpenNebula is a distribution for the community, with migrators that enable the upgrade to the latest but one stable release. It received less frequent maintenance releases than the Enterprise Edition but shares all the functionality with it.
