Overview
================================================================================

Keeping your OpenNebula up-to-date is very important, as you will receive the latest functionality and more importantly, the latest security patches. It is possible to upgrade to the latest OpenNebula release from earlier versions.

Hypervisor Compatibility
================================================================================

The upgrade procedure can be followed regardless of the hypervisor.

How Should I Read This Chapter
================================================================================

You only need to read this chapter if you are upgrading OpenNebula to a newer release. Make sure you have read the :ref:`Release Notes <rn>` and particularly the :ref:`Compatibility <compatibility>` section first.

Upgrading is a sequential procedure. The system will upgrade from the currently installed release to the latest release going through each release (if any). Therefore it's important to read each section.

After the upgrade procedure you can continue using your upgraded OpenNebula Cloud.
