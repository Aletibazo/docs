Overview
==========================

A **Host** is a server that has the ability to run Virtual Machines and that is connected to OpenNebula's Front-end server. OpenNebula can work with Hosts with a heterogeneous configuration, i.e. you can connect Hosts to the same OpenNebula with different hypervisors or Linux distributions. To learn how to prepare the hosts you can read the :ref:`Open Cluster Deployment <open_cluster_deployment>` guide.

**Clusters** are pools of hosts that share datastores and virtual networks.
