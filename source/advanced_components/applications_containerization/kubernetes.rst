Kubernetes
================================================================================

`Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`_ is a Linux container orchestration technology which became de facto standard for cloud native applications. It has a long development lineage at Google before it even got its current name and became open-sourced. `Docker <https://www.docker.com>`_ was supported as the default container runtime from its inception but Kubernetes strives to be runtime-agnostic.

OpenNebula provides integration with the Kubernetes thanks to the `Kubernetes appliance <https://docs.opennebula.io/appliances/service/kubernetes.html>`_.

This appliance supports OpenNebula's :ref:`OneFlow technology <appflow_use_cli>` to readily bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster with the simplicity of just the push of a button. Appliance is also capable of a dynamic scale-in and scale-out of the worker nodes to fit your demands.
