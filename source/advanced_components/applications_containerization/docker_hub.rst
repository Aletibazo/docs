Docker Hub
================================================================================

`Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com>`_ is the official, public and free `Docker <https://www.docker.com>`_ image `registry <https://docs.docker.com/registry/>`_ - a repository of Docker images.

There is an integration with the Docker Hub in the OpenNebula's Marketplace - :ref:`DockerHub Marketplace <market_dh>`. This integration provides a support for the official Docker images hosted on Docker Hub and converts them into disk images which can then be used by :ref:`Firecracker <fcmg>` or :ref:`LXD <lxdmg>`.
